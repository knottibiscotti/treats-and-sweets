Every part of Talula Goodman's body ached as she walked slowly toward town.  Every part she could feel, her feet had gone numb sometime during the night and the only evidence she had they were still there is her continued upright posture.  Her thrice-damned horse had run off in the middle of the night and in a very distant part of her mind she wished it a slow, horrible death.  Coyotes, maybe.  Or a skin-walker.  Coyote skin-walker.

The night had been a blur.  She thought she had been safe enough.  She'd taken all her usual precautions.  No fire, nothing to eat but hardtack and jerky washed down with her last two swallows of Old Orchard.  She'd lost consciousness – she never slept anymore, sleep was something other folks could indulge – under cover of a creosote bush a hundred yards off the road. She'd left the miserable swayback nag another fifty yards past that, hitched to a Ponderosa pine with enough forage around to keep it happy for the night.

Then, sometime in the small hours, she'd come around. If she hadn't, if she hadn't spent most her life a heartbeat away from danger or worse, she might've ended her days in that cold, October pre-dawn.  But the world had hardened Talula – honed her to a razor's edge – and before she was fully awake she was in motion; rolling away from the danger.

Men, of course, two of them.  Maybe they'd followed her all the way from Thornbrook, maybe they'd caught sight of her somewhere after that.  It didn't matter, they both giggled and growled by turns in a way that told Talula all she needed to know.  They didn't want money and they didn't want her gun and they weren't planning to barter for anything they *did* want.

Pity for them they'd expected her to be asleep or passed out, they didn't care, and they expected to slake their thirst maybe before she'd even  come around.  Instead, as the first one was unbuckling his belt and lowering his filthy trousers, her body was already responding in the way she'd practised so well.

There was a deafening crack and an inhuman howl and the man with his pants open fell backward, gibbering and clutching his crotch as the dust between the two of them darkened and clumped into wet wads. Somewhere, very far away, Talula felt a slicing pain in her left hand from where she had torn it open as she fanned the hammer of her Shopkeeper but that might as well be a letter from New York City for all it mattered now.

"Wait!" the second one blurted out, stupidly, as Talula turned her attention to him. He was holding out his hands now in a placating gesture like he could somehow explain away what he and his friend were doing here, what they had planned on doing, all while his friend was sobbing and bleeding out in the dust beneath another bit of brush.  Talula didn't give him time to work up a story, she fanned the hammer again and sent him to meet his maker.

Of course they'd unhitched her horse before they closed in on her.  They'd probably given it a good slap to send it on its way so there'd be no running if she did wake up partway through.  The sobbing wails from the man who wasn't quite dead yet drifted toward her and knowing she still had at least twenty miles to reach *No Regrets* left her to consider what would be more satisfying: taking out her frustration now and using one of her remaining bullets on him or leaving him to the fates.  Would the reaper come for him before the scavengers did?

Talula decided that was a question worth answering.

When she finally staggered, wraith-like, into town Talula considered the possibility that some tenderfoot deputy might mistake her for a real *cabrón* but she only hesitated at the sign for a moment.  She decided that having it all end like that, shot down by some tin star still wet behind the ears, that might be the best she could hope for on returning to *No Regrets*.  As she shuffled down the centre of the town's main street she grew more confident that wasn't in the cards for her today.  At least not yet.

She didn't know the time but the sun had been up for hours now. She didn't think it'd passed noon yet, but it was hard to tell since she couldn't really focus her eyes on anything and measuring her shadow was well beyond her now.  There were people out on the main street, on the boardwalk and down on the dirt with her, and Talula imagined how she must look to them.

She was tall for a woman, almost 5'6" with her boots on, and thin, mostly due to living on the trail, but even when she was living easy she never seemed to be able to get the curves she'd need to be considered properly pretty. Her long, firey red hair was bound in a tight plait and reached down her back just below her shoulders. Her complexion was pale but only relative to other wanderers, her skin had been sunburned again and again and now it more-or-less gave up and decided to tan for her. Her face, despite being shaded by the wide brim of her John B., was covered in freckles so thick she'd never felt really clean as a little girl. Her lips would have been plump and heart-shaped but the last few days had robbed her of so much they were cracked, bleeding and raw.

Her unbleached linen shirt was soaked through with sweat and over it her light brown vest had darkened as well.  Together they did considerable work to hide her natural figure, smoothing and shaping what curves she had, into angles that would never let her pass for a man but also didn't announce to anyone she was of the fairer sex.  Her plain brown trousers were cut for a man and were tight in places that she didn't enjoy when she first put them on. That had been before Thornbrook – in Swiftchapel, she thought – and now they were so loose she regretted not buying the suspenders after all.  Her brown shotgun boots were grey with dust all the way up and were marked with scuffs and gouges almost all the way through. Before her worthless horse had run off, she could've afforded better clothing but she projected the image she wanted: woman or not, it was best to say far away from this person.

"Hello, Lu," Mary's honeyed tone sent a chill up Talula's back and a thrill down her belly. It made her furious.

"The Rose isn't open yet," she rasped in reply, staring intently down at her folded hands as she sat at the bar of The Velvet, the best and only brothel within 50 miles of *No Regrets*.

"No, I imagine they aren't," Mary said softly as her fingertips trailed over Talula's shoulders. "Bert doesn't often wake up before eleven and they never open before Bert's awake."

Blinking slowly, Talula turned her head so she could look Mary Mawdsley in the face.  Somehow she was even more beautiful than Talula remembered.  "It's not noon yet?" she asked quietly, hoping she was keeping the tremor out of her voice but too bone-weary to notice one way or the other.

"How long you been on the road, Lu?" Mary asked.  Her voice, her tone, it was a warm bath, it was a soft bed after a a hard ride, it was everything she wanted out of life.  Her deepest, fondest desire would be to hear Mary's voice first every day and last every night, but she daren't even linger on that thought. That was more dangerous than the bushwackers from last night.

"Left Thornbrook a few days ago coming here. Lost my horse."  She could feel the heat rising in her cheeks and hated herself all the more for it.

"I know why you're here, Lu," Mary said gently while her fingertips continued over the coarse fabric of Talula's vest.  The haggard woman couldn't help but notice how Mary's hand seemed to be moving lower with each light, circular stroke.

"Suppose you do," she replied softly.  "Why'n't you point me at him an' save me some time?" She didn't mean to be curt, in her deep-down Talula wanted to draw out this moment as long as she could, but she didn't have the luxury of giving in to 'want'.  Not yet.  Maybe never.

"You missed him," Mary murmured softly.  She had brought her mouth so close to Talula's ear she could feel the madam's breath on her cheek.  It gave the gunslinger goosebumps.

"You're lyin'," Talula replied, though she sounded far less certain than she'd intended as she locked eyes with Mary.

"Not lying, Lu. He's gone.  He might be back, though.  Why don't you stay a bit?  I'll make sure you get a good rest while you wait." Talula hated herself for how eager she was to accept the offer.

"Everythin' was in the saddle-bags," she said simply.  Her eyes darted from the angel in a crushed velvet bodice to the table on the far side of the game room.  There was a long table set against the wall and laden with food.  Cold cuts, rye bread, salted herring, even some vegetables, celery mostly but carrots too.  Just thinking about it made Talula's mouth water, looking at it was almost too much to bear.  She could go help herself, nobody would protest or try to stop her, but even Talula wasn't so hard up yet – at least she didn't think so – that she would break that rule.  Not even the lowliest deadbeat would eat without buying a couple of drinks too.

Mary smiled in a way that make Talula's painfully empty stomach turn circles.  "You don't gotta pay here, girl, we're family."

"We ain't family," Talula responded flatly.  Suddenly she thought she *did* want to hurt Mary.  They'd schooled together, they'd been the best of friends when they were girls, but events conspired and now Mary Mawdsley was the head of her House and Talula has nothing but a revolver, seven bullets and a hate that kept her warm when the weather turned cold.

"Might as well be," Mary's retort was light, breezy and, Talula thought, more than a little flirty.  *Well, it's what she does.*  "Come on," the madame instructed Talula, gently but firmly pulling her toward the stairs with both hands.  "I'm not hearin' any more arguments outta you." Talula had time to notice the look that passed between Mary and the bespectacled man working behind the bar. He nodded, almost imperceptibly, and had disappeared into the kitchen behind him by the time the two women had reached the second floor.

***

Torn between looking tired and sullen, Talula simply stood inside the door of Mary's personal suite.  It was beautiful, just like the occupant.  The floor had been recently waxed and even though Talula knew it wasn't, she couldn't convince herself that it wasn't wet. The shiplap walls were immaculate and the sitting room had huge windows facing south and a door that opened onto a balcony. There was a white painted table with two chairs in one part of the room, a couch by a wood stove in another and a writing desk in another part.  Off to the right there was a closed door that Talula was sure led to Mary's bedroom.

"Would you please, Lu?" Mary asked gently as she sat down at the table.  "Elbert's fetchin' us something to eat, we can talk while we wait."

Talula opened her mouth and tried to draw forth her harsh bravado, she wanted to say something sharp and biting that would snuff out that look Mary was giving her.  The look of kind welcome, gentle affection, a look she probably even practised in the mirror every morning.  She wanted to put an end to this here and now.  Mary would throw her out and she could sit outside the *Cactus Rose* until Bert finally woke up and opened the door for her.  She wanted that, but her body, her brain, they rebelled.  "Thank you," she said simply and shuffled over to take the seat opposite Mary.

"You been gone a long time, Lu," Mary said after an uncomfortably long pause.  "I know you ain't here to put your guns down."  Did Talula hear a hint of hope in Mary's voice?  "Least not yet."

"Gun. Lost one in Grand Creek," Talula said simply as she tried to read Mary's expression.

"Grand Creek?" Mary asked softly, her brow furrowing in concentration.  "Where's that?  I don't think I ever heard tell of it."

Talula shrugged a little as her attention fixated on Mary's full, soft lips.  "Can't get there from here," she murmured cryptically, repeating the words the medicine man had said to her when he'd told her that the man she was seeking was out of reach.

Mary frowned and for a second Talula's stomach did a flip-flop as she realised she may have succeeded in her goal, having the madam throw her out on the street.  A grim light came over Mary's face and she sat silent for another uncomfortably long moment before opening her mouth to speak once again.  Before she could, though, there was a knock at the door, "Ms. Mawdsley?  L-lunch?"
