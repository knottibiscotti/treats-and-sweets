# Knotty Biscotti's (sometimes) Naughty Treats

Hello there! Thanks for stopping by, I'm still moving in but there's a few things maybe you can look at while you're here.  Check over on the side.

I'm not a writer, not at all, but I do like writing and I've got a head full of characters that want me to tell their stories. The best of those you'll be able to find here.  Enjoy yourself, but be warned, a lot of them are likely to be a bit piquant!

If you somehow found your way here and it wasn't from BlueSky, you should find me on BlueSky, that's the only social media I use at the moment.  But I am also on Ko-Fi, so maybe I'll also be around there once in a while.  I have to be up front about it, I'm not the most reliable person you'll ever meet, so it's hard to know for sure where you'll find me.  For now it's:
